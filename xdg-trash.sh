# RECOMENDED ALIENS:

# IDEAS:
# trash list command shall be able to order by size (date is an obvious variant)
# .. rely on DeletionDate only (heavy costly)
# install this with a simple curl URL command from any directory (required sudo is handled by policy kit?)

# TODO:
# command completion
# do we require bash or is sh good enough?
# naming: 'delete' or 'trash' (it) ? both are reasonable,
# .. but delete IS the most used term in the spec!
# .. if using a command like naming as rubbish does, trash is more reasonable
# read the specification (e.g. on date format: real files stop after the seconds)
# .. DeletionDate=2023-06-14T14:23:13  <<<<!
# use other xdg-* commands as a template
# respect - if doable - user's choice of confirmation on deleting
# full path name requires special treatment (e.g. spaces convert to %20)
# .. [Trash Info]: Path=/home/christian/Accounts%20und%20Passw%C3%B6rter
# should this be an XDG command?
# should we have a "list" mode?
# should we have a "undelete" mode?
# should we have a "final delete" mode (aka 'clear')?
# should we have a rm(1) replacement mode? (i.e. rm might be aliased to delete
# .. but instead of removing files immediatly they are just moved to trash ;)
# .. is $0 'rm' if aliased?
# howto: check for commands (and it's default 'put') resonable and save?
# .. if a command id present it is always $1, or not? users are dump, so ...
# .. go for options first, remove these and the rest is either a command or a
# .. file. what if we try to delete a file names as a command !?!?
# check on existence of trash directory (fail if not present)
# trap cat and mv and exit with code if we fail?
# exit codes:
# 1: generic fail
# 2: failed on creating info or moving one file
# 9: no trash directory or target directories inside


# DEFINITIONS: (from XDG Spec)
# Trash — the storage of files that were trashed (“deleted”) by the user.
# Trashing — a “delete” operation in which files are transferred into the Trash can.
# Erasing — an operation in which files (possibly already in the Trash can) are removed (unlinked) from the file system.
# A “shredding” operation, physically overwriting the data, may or may not accompany an erasing operation
# Original location — the name and location that a file (currently in the trash) had prior to getting trashed.
# Original filename — the name that a file (currently in the trash) had prior to getting trashed.
# “Home trash” directory — a user's main trash directory. Its name and location is defined in this document.

# The Trash:  where meta info and files go
# Spec: $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash - not set on KDE and Gnome
# at least virgin Gnome (and Pop) do not have this directory.
# .. It is initialized via a "To Trash" operation in file manager.
# .. (Including the two subdirectories) and so will we ...
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html
# .. $XDG_DATA_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user specific data files should be stored.
# .. If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used.
